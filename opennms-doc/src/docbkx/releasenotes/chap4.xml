  <para>OpenNMS is written almost entirely in Java, and should be able to run
  on any system that supports the Sun Java Virtual Machine -- OpenNMS 14 requires
  Java 7 or higher.</para>

  <para>The following are the systems that support or are known to run OpenNMS.</para>

					Note that while it is technically possible to install on FAT32, NTFS
					is the only officially supported filesystem for Windows installs.
					Additionally, while Windows is supported, OpenNMS is much more heavily
					tested (and easier to maintain) on UNIX, and it is recommended that
					unless you have a specific reason to go with Windows, that you use
					one of the supported UNIX-based operating systems.

	<para>OpenNMS 14 requires Java 7 JDK or greater, and PostgreSQL 8.4 or greater.
    In addition, for native RRD support (as opposed to the builtin Java-based JRobin
    round-robin database), RRDTool 1.2 is required.</para>
